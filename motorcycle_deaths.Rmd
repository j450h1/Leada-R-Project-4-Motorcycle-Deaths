Let's start off with loading the dataset which was downloaded from the [Gapminder website.](http://www.gapminder.org/data/)

```{r}
mc <- read.csv()
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
