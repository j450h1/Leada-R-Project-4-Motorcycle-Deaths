# Leada-R-Project-4-Motorcycle-Deaths
As I get ready to renew my motorcycle insurance for this year, I thought why not look at how dangerous motorcycling really is. My gut feeling is telling me that Canada is amongst the safest countries in the world to ride a motorcycle. Let's see if the data from Gapminder over the past 30 years supports this.

Questions

1. As of 2008, which country is considered the safest for motorcyclists?
2. Which country has improved its safety the most over the past 10 years?
3. Where does Canada rank in terms of motorcyclist safety?
4. As of 2008, which country is considered the most dangerous for 2-wheelers?
5. How much safer are the 10 safest countries vs the most dangerous?
